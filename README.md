# Pose_Estimation

This project deals with 2 issues: 
1. Use of openCV and Mediapipe to first gain body landmark coordinates on a projected on a 2-d surface.
2. Exploration of possible applications of having this landmark data:



     a. Imgage classification:
     For Image classification, I have used a supervised data of classified images and trained a neural network classification model for possible identification of        various yoga poses using relative positions of body landmarks from the available images.
  
     b. Reps counting for a sample excercise:
     Since the landmark data can be captured for real time videos as well, I have attempted to count the reps for a sample excercise based on the changes in              landmarks relative positions.
